# Mermaid

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.

## About

<!-- <Main description>   -->

> Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.

Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.
But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.<br/>
Mermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams. It can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).<br/>
<br/>

Mermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed diagrams through the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).<br/>

Use Mermaid with your favorite applications, check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/integrations-community.html).

You can also use Mermaid within [GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) as well many of your other favorite applications—check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/integrations-community.html).

# Mermaid Live Editor

Edit, preview and share mermaid charts/diagrams.

## Features

- Edit and preview flowcharts, sequence diagrams, gantt diagrams in real time.
- Save the result as a svg
- Get a link to a viewer of the diagram so that you can share it with others.
- Get a link to edit the diagram so that someone else can tweak it and send a new link back

## Install setup

```cd \mermaid-live-editor
Node.js
npm install -g pnpm@10.30.3
pnpm install
pnpm dev -- --host localhost

Open http://localhost:3000. That's it — it uses the published mermaid package from npm out of the box.
```

## Docker

### Run published image

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --publish 8000:8080 ghcr.io/mermaid-js/mermaid-live-editor
```

The published docker image is built using our default environment variables. You cannot override them when running the image. If you need to customize them, you will need to build the image yourself.

### To configure renderer URL

When building set the MERMAID_RENDERER_URL build argument to the rendering
service.
Example:
Default is`https://mermaid.ink`.
Set to empty string to disable PNG and SVG links under Actions

### To configure Kroki Instance URL

When building set the MERMAID_KROKI_RENDERER_URL build argument to your Kroki
instance.
Default is `https://kroki.io`
Set to empty string to disable Kroki link under Actions

### To configure Analytics

When building set the MERMAID_ANALYTICS_URL build argument to your plausible instance, and MERMAID_DOMAIN to your domain.

Default is empty, disabling analytics.

### To enable Mermaid Chart links and promotion

When building set the MERMAID_IS_ENABLED_MERMAID_CHART_LINKS build argument to `true`

Default is empty, disabling button to save to Mermaid Chart and promotional banner.

### To update the Security modal

The modal shown on clicking the security link assumes analytics, renderer, Kroki
and Mermaid chart are enabled. You can update it by modifying `Privacy.svelte`
if you wish.

### Development

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

### Building and running images locally

#### Build

```bash
docker build -t mermaid-js/mermaid-live-editor .
```

#### Run

```bash
docker run --detach --name mermaid-live-editor --publish 8080:8080 mermaid-js/mermaid-live-editor
```

Visit: <http://localhost:8080>
